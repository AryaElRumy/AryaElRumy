## About Me

I am a passionate Junior Embedded System Engineer with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My work often involves experimenting with the fusion of embedded systems and machine learning to create intelligent systems that can make a real-world impact.

### What I Do

- **Embedded Systems Development**: Designing, developing, and optimizing embedded systems for various applications.
- **Machine Learning**: Building and training models for predictive analytics, classification, and anomaly detection.
- **Deep Learning**: Exploring neural networks and their applications in image processing, natural language processing, and more.
- **Integration**: Combining the power of embedded systems with machine learning algorithms to create smart, autonomous solutions.

### Projects

Here are a few highlights of my projects where I combined embedded systems with machine learning:

- **Fire Monitoring System Using Quadcopter and Raspberry Pi**: developing a quadcopter and equipping it with a Raspberry Pi and FLIR Lepton IR camera. This setup was created to detect and locate potential fires. To classify scenes where fire potentially occurred, I used a support vector classifier. The vehicle coordinates were then sent to the ground control station.
- **Anomaly Detection in Power Meters**: Created a system to detect anomalies in power meter readings using LSTM autoencoders, with real-time data processing and MQTT integration.

### Skills

- **Embedded Systems**: C, C++, Microcontrollers (Arduino, STM32), RTOS
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn
- **Deep Learning**: Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks
- **Integration**: MQTT, IoT, Sensor Networks, Data Processing
